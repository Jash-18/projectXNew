0,Apple___Apple_scab,"Apple scab is one of the most common and most serious diseases of apple and ornamental crabapple trees. It's caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. Apple scab spreads rapidly between 55-75 degrees F when relative humidity is high.","Remove fallen leaves. Remove fallen leaves from around the tree and dispose of them away from the apple tree. This will help reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring",https://extension.umn.edu/sites/extension.umn.edu/files/styles/crop_featured_image/public/apples-with-apple-scab.jpg?itok=CPdt_9SN
1,Apple___Black_rot,"Black rot is occasionally a problem on Minnesota apple trees. The disease can affect fruit, leaves and bark. On fruit, the rot begins as a small, brown, circular spot that may appear wet or dry.","Prune out dead or diseased branches. Pick all dried and shriveled fruits remaining on the trees. Remove infected plant material from the area. All infected plant parts should be burned, buried or sent to a municipal composting site",https://extension.umn.edu/sites/extension.umn.edu/files/styles/crop_featured_image/public/black-rot-on-apple.jpg?itok=Kt2wFudE
2,Apple___Cedar_apple_rust,"Cedar apple rust is a fungal disease that depends on two species to complete its complicated life cycle. Spores overwinter as a reddish-brown gall on young twigs of various juniper species.","Since the juniper galls are the source of the spores that infect the apple trees, cutting them is a sound strategy if there aren't too many of them. While the spores can travel for miles, most of the ones that cause damage are from junipers within a few hundred feet of the apple tree",https://extension.umn.edu/sites/extension.umn.edu/files/styles/crop_featured_image/public/cedar-apple-rust-leaf-spots.jpg?itok=9OOALxBw
